Introducing yourself is the most tricky and awkward task especially when you yourself doesnt know much abosut yourself. Warm 
greetings to all reading this i'm Sharvani shrestha a former student of goldengate international college and now an 
undergratuate first-year student here at herald college kathmandu.I was born in biratnagar at 25/09/05 and raised in kathmandu.
Rightnow i am studying Bsc(hons) in computer science and since i have always liked creative works.I plan on being a ux developer in 
the future.I had really never thought that i would be studing in the computer faculty because this subject scared me to death,
but now with its growing opportunity i plan on taking the risk and try out if my creativity really helps me out.Since ux is not 
just making a web page look attractive but its more than that, it focuses on how to make the web page attractive, easily 
understandable and enjoyable to the user so i really like how a persons creative minds  needs to work onto it.Being a UX 
developer must be challenging but i really think its enjoyable.Apart from the academics i really like singing and musics i think 
it has its own beauty within.
